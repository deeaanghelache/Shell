## Students: Anghelache Andreea, DuÈ›u Maria-Alexandra
## University of Bucharest. Faculty of Computer Science. 2022

This was a project for the Operating Systems course.
We had to implement a shell.

## Compiling the shell
```
    gcc -o ourShell ourShell.c -lreadline
```
## Implemented functions
1. Change Directory (cd) => *cd folder*, *cd ..*, *cd*
2. History 
If you enter the command "history" in our shell, it will show a list with all the commands you have entered before.
Also, you can use the up and down arrows to navigate through the commands you have already entered.
3. Print Working Directory (pwd)
4. Clear (clearScreen)
5. Copy (cp)
6. Make Directory (mkdir)
7. Remove Directory (rmdir)
8. Echo (echo)
9. Redirect input/output
10. Pipe
11. Kill => suspends all the running processes (q)
